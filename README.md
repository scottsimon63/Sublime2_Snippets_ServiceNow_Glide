FileSync: Features: FileSync synchronizes local file changes to mapped records in ServiceNow instances. When a file changes in the parent folder, the file is automatically updated in ServiceNow

Challenges: Console needs to be always running If changed on ServiceNow side, local code is not updated (but you will get a message to synch your local file) Manual process of saving files on the local drive Will allow you to save a file with a syntax error
